Several departments share an AWS environment. To ensure that EC2 instances are properly identified, each instance must have a unique and descriptive name. This Python script will help users generate those names.

Script Requirements
	1.	The script must allow the user to input how many EC2 instance names they need and output the same amount of unique names.
	2.	The script must allow the user to enter the name of their department, which will be included in the unique EC2 name.
	3.	The script must generate random characters and numbers that will be appended to the unique name.
